### Description

This version no longer uses RegObj.dll or the scripting runtime. Also fixed the path problems( I hope).

The Thumblist ViewerPane control takes a folder path as an argument and displays all the Jpeg, Bitmap and Gif images in the folder as thumbnails in a resizable viewer pane. The control supports multi-select and has a built in image viewer and property sheet for the selected image. Images may also be selected for copying, moving and deleting. The control also features a configurable right click context menu. Check the screenshot of the test application.

I have loaded 500 thumbs onto the control with no problem.

Note: to run the test application you will require the Common Controls Replacement Project FolderTreeview Control. You select the source folder on the toolbar using the button next to the textbox . The treeview selects the destination path for copying or moving files.
